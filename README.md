# Functional Programming

Functional Programming is a course given at [CMDA](https://github.com/cmda). This course is part of the [Tech Track](https://github.com/cmda-tt) and will be during Project Information Design.  
More details about my process during the Tech Track and its cources are documented in [my Wiki](https://github.com/GiovanniDw/functional-programming/wiki/)

### Features

- [x] Get, Filter, Clean & transform dataset from Survey Exercise.
- [x] Get external data from API.
- [ ] Clean external API data that i need.
- [ ] Transform the data thats clean.
- [ ] Use D3 to Create Visualisation from clean data.

During this course the code in this repo will use functional patterns to get, filter, clean & transform datasets from external sources about parking. And visualise that data. For more details about te concept and the data go to [the Wiki](https://github.com/GiovanniDw/functional-programming/wiki/Concept)

### Installation

First, clone the repo to your local machine.

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/GiovanniDw/functional-programming.git
```

Then ` $ cd ` into the project folder.

```zsh
npm install
```

Now run the project!

```zsh
npm run dev
```

### API

Most of the data that will be used, comes from the [opendata.rdw.nl](https://opendata.rdw.nl) API.

### Assignment

> Create a data visualisation with d3 based on given data.

**During this course** _I will_  
● Apply functional programming patterns to clean & transform data.
● Develop a concept for _The Volkskrant_ based on external datasets
● Create interactive visualizations with data by using D3
