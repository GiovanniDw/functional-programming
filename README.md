### Features

- [x] Get, Filter, Clean & transform dataset from Survey Exercise.
- [x] Get external data from API.
- [ ] Clean external API data that i need.
- [ ] Transform the data thats clean.
- [ ] Use D3 to Create Visualisation from clean data.

During this course the code in this repo will use functional patterns to get, filter, clean & transform datasets from external sources about parking. And visualise that data. For more details about te concept and the data go to [the Wiki](https://github.com/GiovanniDw/functional-programming/wiki/Concept)

### Installation

First, clone the repo to your local machine.

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/GiovanniDw/functional-programming.git
```

```zsh
npm run dev
```

### API

Most of the data that will be used, comes from the [opendata.rdw.nl](https://opendata.rdw.nl) API.

### Assignment

> Create a data visualisation with d3 based on given data.

**During this course** _I will_
