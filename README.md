# Functional Programming

Functional Programming is a course given at [CMDA](https://github.com/cmda). This course is part of the [Tech Track](https://github.com/cmda-tt) and will be during Project Information Design.  More details  about my process during the Tech Track and the cources are documented in [my Wiki](https://github.com/GiovanniDw/functional-programming/wiki/)

## Features

> My concept is to create an Interactive Visualisation for the cheapest moments(ex. hollidays) to find a parkingspot and differences between in cities.

During this course the code in this repo will use functional patterns to; `filter()`, `clean()` & `transform()` data from external sources about parking. For more details about te concept and the data go to [the Wiki](https://github.com/GiovanniDw/functional-programming/wiki/Concept)


## Installation

First, clone the repo to your local machine.

```zsh
$ git clone https://github.com/GiovanniDw/functional-programming.git
```

Then ` $ cd ` into the project folder.

```zsh
$ npm install
```

Now run the project!

```zsh
$ npm run dev
```

## API

Most of the data that will be used, comes from the [opendata.rdw.nl](https://opendata.rdw.nl) API.
